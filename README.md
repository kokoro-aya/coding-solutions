# My Codewars solutions

**Important**: If you are also playing on codewars, please stop and find your solutions by yourself. This repository is only used by myself and you should never use my solutions as yours.

The repository is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0, but the definition of sharing is only restricted to the sharing of knowledge and using materials as a reference for thinking and inspirations.

This repository contains my solutions for some codewars exercises. These are some of my memories during my learning of programming languages and programming concepts.

I put them here since it has been really a long time the last time I played on codewars and I am not sure if I will continue there. There are some solutions that I think may be interesting for myself to store and to reference in my future study.

Only solutions ranking above or equals to 5 kyu except one will be recorded. This count to 23 katas through 172 completed.
